# 📝 How We Write Documentation

Documentation is not filler. It’s core infrastructure.

We write docs the same way we write code: **clean, intentional, and built to be understood**.

---

## 💡 Audience-First

We’re not just writing for other developers.

We’re writing for journalists, lawyers, researchers, students: for anyone who wants privacy tools without needing a CS degree. Documentation is a form of hospitality.

## 🧠 Teach What, How, and Why

It’s not enough to say what something does. We show:

- **What**: Clear descriptions without assuming context.
- **How**: Real usage examples, not just syntax snippets.
- **Why**: The reasoning and implications, especially on safety or architecture.

---

## 🗣 Tone & Voice

- **Empathetic**: Assume the reader is smart, curious, and occasionally sleep-deprived.
- **Conversational**: Humor and warmth are welcome. Dry prose isn’t a badge of seriousness.
- **Inclusive**: Say “we” where it builds community. Say “you” when guiding. Avoid jargon that excludes.

> “We aren't all teachers, yet we all can teach.”

Your lived experience, your stumbling blocks: they’re valid, valuable, and worthy of inclusion. Write the doc you wish you'd found.

## 📚 Language Principles

- **Jargon isn't evil** if it *teaches*.
    - Acronym first: “We use PII (Personally Identifiable Information) scanning…”
    - Phrase first: “Personally Identifiable Information (PII)…”
- **Markdown with intent**: Use semantic headings to guide navigation.
- **Tight, not terse**: A few extra words can illuminate a whole idea.

---

## 🧱 Structure Suggestions

Each doc ideally includes:

- **Purpose**: Why this exists, who it’s for.
- **Context**: Its role in rMeta.
- **Examples**: Ground it in reality.
- **Edge Cases**: Where things break or behave oddly.
- **Links / Footnotes**: To outside references, specs, or related issues.

## 🕊 Make Someone Feel…

“I didn’t just follow steps. I understand why they work.”

That’s what success looks like. Good docs gift understanding...and maybe a little dignity.
