# rMeta v0.4.0 ‚Äî Clean Your Files, Keep Your Privacy

rMeta is a local-only file metadata scrubber that's fast, secure, and doesn't send your data anywhere **EVER**. Whether you're a journalist, lawyer, researcher, or just someone who wants to keep sensitive files clean, rMeta gives you full control over your privacy.

## Overview

rMeta removes metadata from sensitive files without sending anything over the network. It runs entirely on your machine, inside Docker, and automatically manages its workspace for safety.

You drag a file in, rMeta strips away the noise, and you get a clean version out. No snooping, no nonsense.

- Don't have javascript?  Cool - rMeta only uses it for theme switching.  
- SHA256 hashfile generation
- Optional GPG public key encryption
- Temporary workspace auto-cleans
- **Never** phones home
- Multiple cleanup methods - deletes previous files on startup, shutdown, when you upload new files, and on-demand with handy button control in the webUI.

## Why Should We Care?

This project started when we couldn't find a sole-source piece of kit that could handle multiple filetypes, cost nothing (really), and make us feel comfortable about sharing sensitive files.  We set out to create something:

- **Durable.**  The app's architecture separates concerns, handles validation, and uses ephemeral working directories.
- **Customizable.**  We don't handle files you want?  Write your own handler!
- **Fast.** Asynchronous architecture means rMeta handles multiple files simultaneously - even if there are errors.
- **Smart.** We made sure rMeta does its best to *elegantly* fail while also providing warnings, messages, and logpoints - all accessible by you.
- **Private.** It will **never** send your data anywhere.  Everything is stored in a temporary workspace.  You have full control.
- **Secure.** rMeta can generate SHA256 hashfiles AND use your GPG public key to encrypt files at runtime.

## üóÇÔ∏è Supported File Types

- JPEG ‚Äî In-place metadata scrub

- PDF ‚Äî Metadata library cleanup

- DOCX ‚Äî XML-safe stripping

- XLSX ‚Äî Tag-based metadata removal

- HEIC ‚Äî Converts to JPEG + scrubs

- TXT / CSV ‚Äî Minimal metadata check

## Getting Started

Choose the setup that fits your needs. All options run rMeta locally and keep your files private.

### üü¢ Option 1: Quick and Dirty ‚Äî `docker run`

Fastest way to get started. No setup, no config‚Äîjust run it:

```bash
docker run --rm -d -p 8574:8574 kitquietdev/rmeta:latest
 ```
_This runs the latest published image on Docker Hub in production mode. No volumes, no persistence._

### üü° Option 2: Compose It Right ‚Äî Using `docker-compose.yml`

More structured. Gives you control over config, ports, volumes, environment variables, etc.

```bash
mkdir rmeta && cd rmeta
curl -O https://gitlab.com/kitquietdev/rMeta/-/raw/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

_This uses Gunicorn and production settings. Workspace is managed inside the container._

### üü£ Option 3: Clone + Run ‚Äî Use the Codebase Directly

If you want the source alongside your container for development, customization, or contributions.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/kitquietdev/rMeta.git
cd rMeta
cp docker-compose.yml.example docker-compose.yml
docker compose up
```
_This runs rMeta in development mode with hot reload and mounted volumes._

*Edit the fresh `docker-compose.yml` as needed for your local dev environment.

### **Do not expose this setup to the internet.**
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning

rMeta is designed to run locally. Development mode (flask run) is not hardened and should never be exposed to the internet.

- Dev mode lacks production-grade request handling

- It does not sanitize headers or enforce TLS

- It is intended for local testing only

**If you choose to expose rMeta publicly (e.g., via reverse proxy, tunnel, or port forwarding), you are responsible for securing that setup. Future versions will include proxy-awareness and optional TLS support, but v0.3.0 does not.**

## Architecture Overview

- `flask_renderer.py` ‚Äî Entry point for the app

- `handlers/` ‚Äî File-type-specific logic

- `postprocessors/` ‚Äî Optional encryption, hashing, etc.

- `uploads/` ‚Äî Temporary workspace (auto-managed)

## üß™ Internal Testing Artifacts

The `dev/` directory contains sample files and scripts used during development. It‚Äôs not meant to enforce a test suite ‚Äî it‚Äôs there to illustrate what rMeta was validated against. These assets can help you explore edge cases or understand scrubbing logic in context.

## Simple and Intuitive Workflow
