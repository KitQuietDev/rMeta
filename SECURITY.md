# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you find a security issue in rMeta, please email [your ProtonMail] privately.

Do not submit public issues for sensitive problems. Responsible disclosure is appreciated and will be reviewed promptly.

## Scope

rMeta wraps and uses external libraries and tools. Vulnerabilities in upstream dependencies should be reported to their respective maintainers.

We aim to respond quickly to issues arising from integration or project-specific behavior.
